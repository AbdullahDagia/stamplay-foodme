===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform with [Stamplay-JS-SDK](https://stamplay.com/docs/jssdk) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to show you how to build a take-out food ordering application, like [JustEat](http://justeat.com).**

*JustEat is a quickly growing online take-out ordering service, on target to deliver almost 100 million orders by the end of 2015. Fast food is big business.*

IN this project we’re going to be building an online fast-food ordering application, like JustEat

In just 30 minutes you’ll learn how to:

* sign up users with an email and password
* sort and filter by category, rating and pricing
* accept orders from logged in and guest users
* add a rating system
* set up notifications for when an order is submitted
* create an ‘Admin’ section to review orders and manage inventory

[This is what you'll build](https://foodme.stamplayapp.com/#/).
